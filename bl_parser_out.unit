 Project Title: Beacon Hill Preparatory Institute Social Media Strategy 2014
 Project Descriptipon: Beacon Hill Preparatory Institute seeks assistance in rethinking its current social media strategy. Our primary goal is to attract prospective students, parents, donors and partners while fostering engagement among current students and alumni. Secondarily, our aim is to expand national brand recognition of Beacon Hill as a leading progressive voice in Supplemental education policy — serving as both a model and a resource for policymakers. We are seeking a volunteer who will audit our current social media audiences, recommend methods of engagement, and aid staff in beginning to implement a new, holistic social media strategy in line with broader communications goals.
A strengthened social media strategy will not only reinforce our presence within Dallas, but will also allow us to share our exceptional research on Early Childhood intervention with educators throughout the country.

 Project Title: Beacon Hill Preparatory Institute Requirements for Application/Database Development 2014
 Project Descriptipon: Beacon Hill understands the need to have current technology in place and well maintained. Technology helps us track and document data, communicate with students, parents, partners, donors and the public and ultimately fulfill our vision of ensuring ALL students are prepared to lead in a competitive, academic and global environment when they graduate from High School. 
Volunteers could help us with the research and implementation of a database management system that provides Student,parent and staff project workflow and allows viewing, tracking or extraction of data, by all staff of the organization. Our current “system” which consists of an Excel spreadsheets and other applications, is not providing us an efficient means to accomplish this, is not user friendly and is inaccessible by some staff due to the various file locations and tools in place. Over the years we ve researched some options, but funding, staff knowledge and time are the most difficult challenges we face in moving forward with this. We are open to suggestions for other systems or ways to modify our current configuration.

 Project Descriptipon: We have already been using SF for a few years.  Last year we had a change in our fiscal year dates, and we made the mistake of messing up our standard FY to try to set up "customized FY" and it completely ruined our rollup fields we use for some fundraising data.  We need those rollup fields to be fixed and our fiscal year dates to be fixed.  It requires SF coding experience.

 Project Title: PTAlink Software Selection
 Project Descriptipon: PTAlink.org is a rapidly growing web-based resource center dedicated to improving NYC public school education and parent engagement by making parent organizations stronger and more effective. Along with information, tools and resources that PTAs need, the site provides parent leaders with the opportunity to share best practices and strategies, building a collaborative community of PTAs across public schools. To further this goal, and at the request of many parent organization leaders, we plan to add to the site a moderated forum where parent leaders can ask questions of and provide answers to others about their work in schools. We seek assistance choosing an appropriate module for the forum and integrating it into our (Word Press) site.

Yes She Can Inc. operates Girl AGain, a resale boutique for American Girl dolls (we use this retail environment to teach job skills to women with autism).  We get used merchandise and we need an inventory management system that is simple and that we can train our workers to use.  There are a number of consignment software packages but they seem too complex and not relevant to our needs.  We need help to assess them and to determine if we just need a custom designed simple system.

 Project Title: Children's Chorus of Washington Technology Selection Advisor
 Project Descriptipon: Children s Chorus of Washington (CCW) is internationally recognized and critically acclaimed for its seventeen-year history of outstanding artistry. CCW has reached five continents through domestic and international tours, recordings, and frequent appearances on public radio and television. Our extraordinary music education programs, which engage and educate vocalists ages 6 to 18, help youth develop as musicians and leaders, regardless of background, economic status, or prior experience. Our five auditioned ensembles perform frequently with leading music organizations, including the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO), Choral Arts Society, and The Washington Chorus, at Washington, DC s most prestigious venues such as Strathmore Music Hall and The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. SING PREP, an inclusive program, introduces first-time singers to the choral experience.

CCW is a small non-profit that has never had a real database for tracking all of our families, donors, alumni, and audience members. We have been using Excel for all of our records, but we ve grown big enough that we need a real database to make sure all the information about our extended family is in one place. In order to continue expanding sustainably, we are in search of an affordable CRM that also has the capacity to sell tickets to concerts and events (we have not been satisfied with our current ticket vendor), and in an ideal world, to also track chorister registration. These technological tools will help us spread our mission and our music to a greater audience and ensure that we can stay in contact with the CCW family for years to come.

So, it would be extremely useful for volunteers to discuss their own high school experience and how the preparation as a high school student prepared him or her or them for college and an eventual career. Since our school has a STEM focus, we are hoping to start with folks from any field related to science, technology, engineering, or math. Oh, and we ll serve lunch during one of the sessions!

 Project Descriptipon: Queens Vocational & Technical High School is committed to preparing our students with the critical thinking, problem solving and team building skills necessary to meet the demands of a highly technical and ever expanding global economy. Our dual mission is to graduate students who are not only ready for post-secondary education, but who can also readily integrate into our work force as skilled, productive, contributing citizens. Therefore, here at Queens Vocational and Technical High School we offer our students vocational and technical trade courses that can serve as a beneficial purpose to both the student and future work force. Our students are prepared to succeed in and out of the New York City Department of Education.  

To further advance the students  Computer Technology & Networking skills, we are seeking a Work-Based Learning opportunity from your establishment, supporting 1 or more students, to come learn and apply their knowledge in the real-world of work.
11th and 12th grade (16-18 years old) students are required to complete 60 Work-Based Learning hours over the course of 2 years as they are preparing to take the CompTIA A+ Certification.  Students placed at your establishment will already be proficient in: 

•	Fundamentals of computer hardware
•	Fundamentals of computer software & operating systems 
•	Portable/mobile devices 
•	Printers/scanners
•	Networking & security 
•	Terminating RJ-45 cables 
•	Basic Electronics Technology (circuit analysis, electronic construction)

As a host for these students, your establishment will change these students  lives by helping them graduate with a CTE endorsed high school diploma, providing direct, real world, hands-on, experiences, professional development within their CTE major, and preparing individuals to be productive members of society.

Students are available immediately in the fall 2014 or in the spring 2015. Students can work on their days off, after-school, and weekends as needed.

Preliminary site visit will be conducted by QVTHS prior to student placement. Students are closely monitored and supported by the school to ensure a positive experience for all.

 Project Title: Brooklyn Arts Council Strategic Technology Planning 2014
 Project Descriptipon: Brooklyn Arts Council (BAC) is the leading organization supporting and connecting the fast-growing arts and cultural community in Brooklyn. We give grants, present free and affordable arts events, train artists and arts professionals, teach students, incubate new projects, and promote artists and cultural groups across the borough. As Brooklyn s cultural anchor since 1966, BAC has also been the catalyst helping the arts community grow. We ve evolved along with the borough in recent years, but our technological infrastructure hasn t always kept pace with our changing needs. Thus, we to develop a new technology plan to guide us into the future. Ultimately, this project will equip us to better serve the growing number of artists and cultural groups in Brooklyn, and to connect Brooklyn residents of all ages and backgrounds with arts experiences.

 Project Title: Community Solutions Inc Planning to Migrate to the Cloud 2014
 Project Descriptipon: The Brownsville Partnership seeks assistance in developing a database to support our effort to place 5,000 Brownsville residents into jobs. Brownsville Brooklyn faces many challenges, chief among them is the communities lack of employment. For example, we are in the beginning of the campaigns prototype stage where we are working with three public housing buildings.  70% of working age residents in these buildings are unemployed, which is only slightly above the average unemployment rate for public housing residents which constitutes over 30% of housing in Brownsville. 

This database will be the foundation for 1. tracking the path of a Brownsville resident from assessment to placement and 2. tracking improvements in the efficiency of the system we develop to place residents into jobs. 

The data about employability of residents and the barriers in making them employable should be stored in a enterprise  database, so its easier to analyze the data and generate intelligent reports(suggested database to start with: MySQL).

For punching in the data (from a questionnaire on employability for Brownsville residents), a lightweight web application should be developed, that would allow for easier input and provide access for multiple users to simultaneously record/update the details(suggested technologies for creating the webapp: Open source Apache Tomcat web server and Spring Framework).

Once the application development is complete and its deemed fit for production use, the application can be deployed on a Cloud based PaaS solution like Red Hat OpenShift or Google App Engine.
 
We are very grateful for the opportunity to post this project and look forward to collaborating on the project in the future.

 Project Title: Crisis Food Center, Inc. Technology Selection Advisor 2014
 Project Descriptipon: The Crisis Food Center is a food pantry distributing a 5-day supply of nutritionally balanced food to nearly 30,000 a year.  We are proud of the commitment to health that sets us apart from most pantries.  We are also proud of the summertime program that feeds children breakfast and lunch in the safety of their own homes.  However, keeping track of our clients and their statistics could use improvement.  At the end of the year, we must physically go through each of more than 8000 records to extract the information we need for our records and to report to those who fund us.  As old as I am, I know this does not need to be.  Computers can do this with the right software.  But what is the right software?  Which data base already does what we need it to do.  As old as I am I also know there are people who are trained to know what software I need.  I honestly think whoever helps the Crisis Food Center with this project could in fact be saving my sanity.

 Project Title: DISABILITY RIGHTS WISCONSIN INC Website Review and Assessment 2014
 Project Descriptipon: Disability Rights Wisconsin is a private nonprofit organization which was founded in 1977. Designated by the Governor to ensure the rights of all state citizens with disabilities through individual advocacy and system change, DRW is part of a national system of federally mandated independent disability agencies. Disability Rights Wisconsin serves people of all ages, including people with developmental disabilities, people with mental illness, people with physical or sensory disabilities, and people with traumatic brain injury.

Our website is a valuable resource for individuals with disabilities including their caregivers.  We feel our current site could provide so much more to a population who has had so many cuts to programs and to changes to their living situation.  We have many staff that have a wealth of information we can provide to the individuals that contact us.  Our current site does not reflect that wealth we hold.  Our resources are limited because of federal cuts to our grants.  There are so many elements we would like to add, but have limited staff time or limited knowledge in doing so.  We really would like to add a more seamless way to review our publications instead of just using adobe reader.  We would like to provide interactive QandA on several issues that impact our clients. The design of our site is very dated  and needs a fresh new look. We need an expert to review our website and provide recommendations on how it can be improved to help us better serve our clients.

 Project Title: Community Guilds STE(A)M "Build" Programming
 Project Descriptipon: Community Guilds will help close the opportunity gap in public education by providing transformational apprenticeships and mobile innovation labs. Our STE(A)M Truck inspires youth to learn Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math by bringing the coolest tools, equipment and mentors directly to school.

STE(A)M Truck allows youth to design solutions, tackle real problems and then build something together.  As a vehicle (literally and figuratively) to close the opportunity gap, STE(A)M Truck (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math)is both an innovation lab and mobile makerspace.  

We need volunteers during the Build phase of this program.  The Build activities happen over the course of 10 days, afterschool, and push students to move from brainstorming to crafting, building their confidence with the available tools. Volunteers with expertise in one or more of the following skills are desired:

Teaching middle school youth
3D printing/CAD
Wood working/CNC routing/metal working
Youth geared computer programming and app development (ie Scratch, MIT App Inventor) 
Basic electronics/Arduinos

Our next Build phase will take place several afternoons per week starting in mid September through mid October (dates tbd) and at KIPP South Fulton Academy:

 Project Title: City Colleges of Chicago Guest Speakers 2014
 Project Descriptipon: We are recruiting Networking Technology professionals to be guest speakers for college students who are interested in pursuing careers in IT but who may have had little exposure to the actual duties, skills, and knowledge necessary to work in this field.  
 
Each guest speaker will give a 20-minute presentation to provide students with an industry overview, as well as specifics related to job duties, typical working hours, skills needed for success, and the speaker s own experiences and opinions about working in this field. 

Our students tend to be very visual and tactile learners, so we encourage guest speakers to prepare presentations which actively engage the audience, rather than a giving a formal lecture.  We welcome the use of PowerPoints, videos, and other media.  

Each IT professional will be paired with a guest speaker working in another IT-related area, and after both speakers have given their presentations the students will then have an opportunity to ask questions.  Each guest speaker panel will take approximately one hour and twenty minutes, and the audience size will range from 15-25 students.

We are looking for guest speakers at 6 of our colleges: Harold Washington, Daley, Olive-Harvey, Kennedy-King, Wright, and Truman.  We have a variety of dates and times available, ranging from 10/27 – 11/21 and from 8:00am to 5:30pm.  Locations, dates, and times are flexible.

 Project Title: Tomorrow's Hunter Web Site Light Maintenance with DRUPAL 2014
 Project Descriptipon: We provide kids with a positive learning experience that encompasses conservation, wildlife knowledge and management, firearms safety and responsibility, outdoor skills and respect for nature and each other. We strive every day to be an advocate and a voice for all kids.

We would like to implement a series of   My First  templates so that our young folks can upload a photo and pertinent data to create a printable PDF to capture and frame the memory of their first hunt, first deer, first fish, first gun, first bow, first target shoot and  first BB gun.

Our site http://youthoutdoors.org/ is built using Drupal 7 and we need a Drupal developer to build the custom forms. We would also like to save the PDFs into a photo gallery on the site.

 Project Title: The Respite, A Centre for Grief and Hope Technology Selection Advisor 2014
 Project Descriptipon: The Respite, A Centre for Grief & Hope is for those who have suffered great tragedy, a significant life loss, a trauma, a life-shaking, earth-shattering event or series of events… And, it is also for those who are living with every day losses which are life-changing and life-evolving. 

We want to start offering online classes. We want to be able to reach as many people as possible with important tools and education about grief and finding hope. Having an online class option will make our resources accessible to anyone with a computer. It will also provide us with another revenue stream so we can continue to offer our services. 

We need help with selecting the best platform/software to do this, and perhaps help us with implementation. We have a WordPress website so perhaps there is a good plugin that could be integrated? We are also open to a "stand alone" platform that can be customized to our brand. We will need the platform to offer both webinar formats (visual and audio), a place where docs, videos, etc. can be stored and downloaded by the clients, and perhaps have online forms. Since we are a non-profit we need this to be low-cost or even free.(We might have some money from a possible grant that we could put toward this as well.)

The Association for Neurologically Impaired Brain Injured Children, ANIBIC, provides services to people with special needs. ANIBIC is dedicated to enabling individuals to reach their potential so that they may live as productively as possible.
We offer a broad range of services for children as young as five and throughout adulthood. We understand that people with special needs are people first and that their individual challenges are just part of what makes them special.
 
We have determined that our servers are outdated and are considering migrating to the Cloud. Before we can make the decision we need someone to assist us with considering the benefits and drawbacks of having our information in the Cloud. We are specifically interested in learning what data could be moved to the cloud, would we retain ownership of our data and what are the security concerns of the Cloud? Having information easily shared and accessible will allow us to be more effective and serve more special needs children and their families.

 Project Descriptipon: The Association for Neurologically Impaired Brain Injured Children, ANIBIC, provides services to people with special needs. ANIBIC is dedicated to enabling individuals to reach their potential so that they may live as productively as possible.
We offer a broad range of services for children as young as five and throughout adulthood. We understand that people with special needs are people first and that their individual challenges are just part of what makes them special.

We have determined that our servers are outdated and considering options for replacement. Before we make a large investment in new servers we need a volunteer to review our overall  use of technology including hardware and software and make recommendations that will support our continued growth. Having this information and general recommendations will enable us to make informed decisions about our future technology planning and purchases.
