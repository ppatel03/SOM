The Children s Advocacy Center (CAC) provides a place where trauma stops and justice and healing begin. The CAC is modeled on the simple but powerful concept of multidisciplinary coordination to create a best-in-class response to incidents of child abuse. We are working to implement an integrated database system with our city partners to be able to case track our clients, improve communication and coordination of information, and identify system gaps.  We are looking to receive further help from someone who has a deeper knowledge on software databases and help provide advice on which database and best approaches.","color":"indigo","organization_website":"The mission of the San Francisco Child Abuse Prevention Center is to prevent child abuse and reduce its devastating impact.","documentNumber":53,"radius":5,"x_axis":72.25308668352292,"organization_name":"San Francisco Child Abuse Prevention Center","social_sector":"No"},{"y_axis":930.2408169512571,"tech_sector":"No","situation_description":"PTAlink.org is a rapidly growing web-based resource center dedicated to improving NYC public school education and parent engagement by making parent organizations stronger and more effective.

We want to be able to reach as many people as possible with important tools and education about grief and finding hope. Having an online class option will make our resources accessible to anyone with a computer. It will also provide us with another revenue stream so we can continue to offer our services. \n\nWe need help with selecting the best platform/software to do this, and perhaps help us with implementation. We have a WordPress website so perhaps there is a good plugin that could be integrated? We are also open to a \"stand alone\" platform that can be customized to our brand. We will need the platform to offer both webinar formats (visual and audio), a place where docs, videos, etc. can be stored and downloaded by the clients, and perhaps have online forms.
