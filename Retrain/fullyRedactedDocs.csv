Each IT professional will be paired with a guest speaker working in another IT-related area, and after both speakers have given their presentations the students will then have an opportunity to ask questions.  Each guest speaker panel will take approximately one hour and twenty minutes, and the audience size will range from 15-25 students.

This database will be the foundation for 1. tracking the path of a Brownsville resident from assessment to placement and 2. tracking improvements in the efficiency of the system we develop to place residents into jobs. 

The data about employability of residents and the barriers in making them employable should be stored in a enterprise  database, so its easier to analyze the data and generate intelligent reports(suggested database to start with: MySQL).

For punching in the data (from a questionnaire on employability for Brownsville residents), a lightweight web application should be developed, that would allow for easier input and provide access for multiple users to simultaneously record/update the details(suggested technologies for creating the webapp: Open source Apache Tomcat web server and Spring Framework).

Once the application development is complete and its deemed fit for production use, the application can be deployed on a Cloud based PaaS solution like Red Hat OpenShift or Google App Engine.

"YHPIM"|||||"x"|"This is a simple web-based inventory management software written in PHP (MySQL) with CodeIgniter. This was specifically written for a high school but with a bit of tweaking, should work fine for others too. Features •Typical inventory-management. Add stuff to stock, issue them and the software keeps track of numbers, costs, etc. •Also manages multiple suppliers, warehouses, etc. So you know whom you buy certain things with and where they're stored. •Also has a vehicle mileage tracker originally meant to track school bus mileages). Add refueling data and it'll show you what mileage you're getting with nice graphs about how your mileage and fuel consumption has been varying. • Different user-levels. • Different customer types (with varying profit margins for each). •Produces numerous reports about how you're doing, what a particular customer has been buying, how the purchase of a certain product going, etc.Usage Like said above, unless you're using it for a school, might need some tweaking. Just install it and see what needs to be changed. I cannot implement them for you but will answer any question you might have about the current code if you email me. •Extract everything. •Create a database using the SQL dump provided. The dump provided has some sample data in it. Use them to explore the system. You can empty them after installation as well. Also make sure to add a user while importing the dump. •Update ./application_fa93g/config/database.php to the correct host, DB name, user and password. You might also have to update the table prefix if you've changed them in the database."

It has been supercededd by Adrien Thebo's module which can be found here: http://forge.puppetlabs.com/adrien/network Overview This module provides types for network management : • Device configuration files using the network_config type • Live network management using the network_interface type Note: network_interface and network_config types are not dependant on each other in any way. network_interface is experimental. The 'network_config' type The network_config type is used to maintain persistent network configuration. Only redhat-derivatives (RHEL,Fedora,CentOS) are currently supported."
"YPWPR"|||||"x"|"A Network Management UI for global admins in a WordPress Multisite environment Turn your multi-site installation of WordPress into many multi-site networks, all surrounding one central user base. YPWPR allows cape wearing super-admins to create new networks of sites, allowing for infinitely extensible site, network, and domain arrangements."
"YUFWI"|||||"x"|"A discovery service and client for finding and configuring razberi devices over the network. Also provides a central server for collecting status information from razberis on the network. The central server can be configured in a variety of ways: • A standalone server that runs on a single unit (good for when the deployment only has a single razberi) • A server located on the LAN that all units on the network can reach (good for when all sites are connected via a VPN or are located on the same subnet as the management server) • A server located in the cloud, hosted by Razberi (good for when sites are independently setup and all have a route to the internet, also reduces burden of hosting a management server)The razberi devices are configured to push relevant information about itself to the central server on a periodic basis."
"YYKNF"|||||"x"|"The goal of this project is to have a unified way of programming your large-scale dynamic networks. Think of it as a blend between puppet, nagios, collectd, graphite, shipyard, security groups, cloudformation. How does it work? YYKNF allows you to define your network as a set of resources in a .yml file. Example resource types: • Nodes • NetworkInterfaces • Classes • IpRuleSets •...etc Each 'Resource' has a unique id and can have zero or more classes. The id and class structure allows you to target your resources in comparable way to CSS selectors. Once you have defined your network (resources) in a .yml file, you can load the topology into memory. The loaded structure can now be used to develop various network-based configuration management tools. Example tools:• Distributed iptable rules generator: Define rules by referencing other nodes by id or classname (dynamic configuration) • Configuration management: define installed packages, and generate config files per host • Monitorring: define monitorring rules by classnames per host Please refer to the example/ directory for example network configurations. This project is in early-stage development Installation This project uses composer to manage it's dependencies. Simply run composer install to install all dependencies in the vendor/ directory."
