Situation Description : Queens Vocational & Technical High School is committed to preparing our students with the critical thinking, problem solving and team building skills necessary to meet the demands of a highly technical and ever expanding global economy. Our dual mission is to graduate students who are not only ready for post-secondary education, but who can also readily integrate into our work force as skilled, productive, contributing citizens. Therefore, here at Queens Vocational and Technical High School we offer our students vocational and technical trade courses that can serve as a beneficial purpose to both the student and future work force. Our students are prepared to succeed in and out of the New York City Department of Education.  

To further advance the students  Computer Technology & Networking skills, we are seeking a Work-Based Learning opportunity from your establishment, supporting 1 or more students, to come learn and apply their knowledge in the real-world of work.
11th and 12th grade (16-18 years old) students are required to complete 60 Work-Based Learning hours over the course of 2 years as they are preparing to take the CompTIA A+ Certification.  Students placed at your establishment will already be proficient in: 

•	Fundamentals of computer hardware
•	Fundamentals of computer software & operating systems 
•	Portable/mobile devices 
•	Printers/scanners
•	Networking & security 
•	Terminating RJ-45 cables 
•	Basic Electronics Technology (circuit analysis, electronic construction)

As a host for these students, your establishment will change these students  lives by helping them graduate with a CTE endorsed high school diploma, providing direct, real world, hands-on, experiences, professional development within their CTE major, and preparing individuals to be productive members of society.

Students are available immediately in the fall 2014 or in the spring 2015. Students can work on their days off, after-school, and weekends as needed.

Preliminary site visit will be conducted by QVTHS prior to student placement. Students are closely monitored and supported by the school to ensure a positive experience for all.

Our current “system” which consists of an Excel spreadsheets and other applications, is not providing us an efficient means to accomplish this, is not user friendly and is inaccessible by some staff due to the various file locations and tools in place. Over the years we ve researched some options, but funding, staff knowledge and time are the most difficult challenges we face in moving forward with this. We are open to suggestions for other systems or ways to modify our current configuration.

Situation Description : Disability Rights Wisconsin is a private nonprofit organization which was founded in 1977. Designated by the Governor to ensure the rights of all state citizens with disabilities through individual advocacy and system change, DRW is part of a national system of federally mandated independent disability agencies. Disability Rights Wisconsin serves people of all ages, including people with developmental disabilities, people with mental illness, people with physical or sensory disabilities, and people with traumatic brain injury.

Our website is a valuable resource for individuals with disabilities including their caregivers.  We feel our current site could provide so much more to a population who has had so many cuts to programs and to changes to their living situation.  We have many staff that have a wealth of information we can provide to the individuals that contact us.  Our current site does not reflect that wealth we hold.  Our resources are limited because of federal cuts to our grants.  There are so many elements we would like to add, but have limited staff time or limited knowledge in doing so.  We really would like to add a more seamless way to review our publications instead of just using adobe reader.  We would like to provide interactive QandA on several issues that impact our clients. The design of our site is very dated  and needs a fresh new look. We need an expert to review our website and provide recommendations on how it can be improved to help us better serve our clients.

We want to start offering online classes. We want to be able to reach as many people as possible with important tools and education about grief and finding hope. Having an online class option will make our resources accessible to anyone with a computer. It will also provide us with another revenue stream so we can continue to offer our services.

We are also open to a "stand alone" platform that can be customized to our brand. We will need the platform to offer both webinar formats (visual and audio), a place where docs, videos, etc. can be stored and downloaded by the clients, and perhaps have online forms.

Situation Description : We have already been using SF for a few years.  Last year we had a change in our fiscal year dates, and we made the mistake of messing up our standard FY to try to set up "customized FY" and it completely ruined our rollup fields we use for some fundraising data.  We need those rollup fields to be fixed and our fiscal year dates to be fixed.  It requires SF coding experience.

Along with information, tools and resources that PTAs need, the site provides parent leaders with the opportunity to share best practices and strategies, building a collaborative community of PTAs across public schools. To further this goal, and at the request of many parent organization leaders, we plan to add to the site a moderated forum where parent leaders can ask questions of and provide answers to others about their work in schools. We seek assistance choosing an appropriate module for the forum and integrating it into our (Word Press) site.

Situation Description : The Brownsville Partnership seeks assistance in developing a database to support our effort to place 5,000 Brownsville residents into jobs. Brownsville Brooklyn faces many challenges, chief among them is the communities lack of employment. For example, we are in the beginning of the campaigns prototype stage where we are working with three public housing buildings.  70% of working age residents in these buildings are unemployed, which is only slightly above the average unemployment rate for public housing residents which constitutes over 30% of housing in Brownsville. 

This database will be the foundation for 1. tracking the path of a Brownsville resident from assessment to placement and 2. tracking improvements in the efficiency of the system we develop to place residents into jobs. 

The data about employability of residents and the barriers in making them employable should be stored in a enterprise  database, so its easier to analyze the data and generate intelligent reports(suggested database to start with: MySQL).

For punching in the data (from a questionnaire on employability for Brownsville residents), a lightweight web application should be developed, that would allow for easier input and provide access for multiple users to simultaneously record/update the details(suggested technologies for creating the webapp: Open source Apache Tomcat web server and Spring Framework).

Once the application development is complete and its deemed fit for production use, the application can be deployed on a Cloud based PaaS solution like Red Hat OpenShift or Google App Engine.
 
We are very grateful for the opportunity to post this project and look forward to collaborating on the project in the future.

We have determined that our servers are outdated and considering options for replacement. Before we make a large investment in new servers we need a volunteer to review our overall  use of technology including hardware and software and make recommendations that will support our continued growth. Having this information and general recommendations will enable us to make informed decisions about our future technology planning and purchases.

We are proud of the commitment to health that sets us apart from most pantries.  We are also proud of the summertime program that feeds children breakfast and lunch in the safety of their own homes.  However, keeping track of our clients and their statistics could use improvement.  At the end of the year, we must physically go through each of more than 8000 records to extract the information we need for our records and to report to those who fund us.  As old as I am, I know this does not need to be.  Computers can do this with the right software.  But what is the right software?  Which data base already does what we need it to do.  As old as I am I also know there are people who are trained to know what software I need.  I honestly think whoever helps the Crisis Food Center with this project could in fact be saving my sanity.
